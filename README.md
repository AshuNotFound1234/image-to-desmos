So this is a lil fun project i made while trying to learn dealing with images using python

the resolution of the image depends on the value 'i', the max vlaue of i is approx 0.0103
tho it will take it forever to paste the code in desmos if you set i<0.011, default i=0.03

so first put your image in this folder, then change "rickroll.png" (in color.py) to whatever the name of your image is
then run both color.py and gridmaker.py
it will generate the code in color.txt and points.txt in desmos format
copy paste both the code in color.txt and points.txt into desmos on two seperate lines
activate the color c into P, in desmos.

this example is https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qv16xhtd0i
