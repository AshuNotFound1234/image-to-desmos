So this is a lil fun project i made while trying to learn dealing with images using python

the resolution of the image depends on the value 'i', the max vlaue of i is approx 0.0103
tho it will take it forever to paste the code in desmos if you set i<0.011
default i=0.03

so first put the image in this folder, then change "rickroll.png" in color.py, then both color and gridmaker.py
copy paste both the text in color.txt and points.txt into desmos on two seperate lines
activate the color c into P, in desmos.
